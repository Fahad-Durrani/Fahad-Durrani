- Developed a **content-based recommendation system** supporting multiple restaurant brands by building an **ETL pipeline** to process item metadata (title, description, ingredients) from MongoDB, with cronjobs for periodic updates.  
- Utilized **Hugging Face multilingual sentence embeddings** to generate vector representations for food items, enabling semantic similarity-based recommendations and solving the **cold start problem** with content-only embeddings.  
- Serialized embeddings as pickle files and stored them on **Amazon S3** using multipart uploads for efficient large-scale data handling.  
- Evaluated and optimized system performance using recommender metrics like **CTR, Coverage, Diversity, Novelty, Churn, and Responsiveness**, improving recommendation quality and user experience.  
- Built and maintained a **data analysis pipeline** feeding into **Power BI dashboards** to monitor restaurant churn, user behavior, and overall performance with actionable insights.  
- Deployed the end-to-end recommendation system on **AWS infrastructure**, ensuring scalability and seamless integration.  
- Integrated a **WhatsApp chatbot** as an AI-powered auto-catalogue assistant:  
  - Captured user cravings and extracted food-related entities using **NER with Hugging Face Transformers**.  
  - Retrieved food recommendations via the content-based recommendation engine.  
  - Estimated restaurant proximity using **Haversine distance**, **Google Distance Matrix**, and **Geocoding APIs** to recommend nearby restaurants.  

**🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, MongoDB, AWS S3, AWS EC2, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch Serve, Pandas, PowerBI, Google Maps APIs
